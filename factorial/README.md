#Goal
We're going to write a Ruby method `factorial` to compute the [factorial](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial) of an integer, creating both an iterative solution and a recursive solution.

##Factorial, Iteratively

Implement an iterative version of the factorial function called `factorial_iterative`. It should accept any non-negative integer as input. Don't worry about handling bad input.

[Iteration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iteration#Computing) in computing is the repetition of a block of statements within a computer program. It can be used both as a general term, synonymous with repetition, and to describe a specific form of repetition with a mutable state.

##Factorial, Recursively

Implement a recursive version of the factorial function called `factorial_recursive`. It should accept any non-negative integer as input. Don't worry about handling bad input.

[Recursion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_%28computer_science%29) in computer science is a method where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem (as opposed to iteration).

##Tests
Any solution that you create should make the p tests pass (equal true) when you run the script.
