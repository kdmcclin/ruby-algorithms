## Ruby Algorithms

In this repository you will find a number of practice algorithms.  Right now they tend towards basic ones, but more complex ones will be added in the future.  Each sub-folder contains a specific drill.  The master branch will contain the template, or blank version of the code, along with any necessary instructions.  The solutions branch will contain a possible solution for each problem, although like many things in life there is usually more than one way to go about it.

Feel free to fork this and work on it in your own space.  If you've got example algorithms that you'd like to add, please create a directory and submit a pull request.  They would be very welcome.
