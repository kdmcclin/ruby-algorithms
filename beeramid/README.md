#Beeramid

Let's pretend your company just hired your friend from college and paid you a referral bonus. Awesome! To celebrate, you're taking your team out to the terrible dive bar next door and using the referral bonus to buy, and build, the largest three-dimensional beer can pyramid you can. And then probably drink those beers, because let's pretend it's Friday too.

A beer can pyramid will square the number of cans in each level - 1 can in the top level, 4 in the second, 9 in the next, 16, 25...

Complete a beeramid method to return the number of complete levels of a beer can pyramid you can make, given the parameters of:

1) your referral bonus, and

2) the price of a beer can

For example
```
beeramid(1500, 2) // should === 12
beeramid(5000, 3) // should === 16
```

##Tests

There are tests already on file, but you should add more to prove that your code works correctly. Are there any edge cases you need to consider?

Any solution that you create should pass the given tests (evaluate to true).
